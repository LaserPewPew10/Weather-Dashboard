# Weather-Dashboard

Worked with Lana Huhko, Camrynne Sullivan, Mike Haber, Melissa Mercado and James Kim for the Weather-Dashboard.
It was quite challenging to incorporate the five day forecast based of the fact of placing it with the api key.
It was also quite challenging to incorporate a localStorage within the javascript.
I incorporated a list for the function for the five day forecast to ultimately show the temperature, humidity, wind speed and the specific icon of what the weather is like.
As well as adding the units for the specific temperature, humidity and wind speed.
I also added a UV index for the date that the user uses the weather dashboard, it will also showcase the color of the specific uv index being shown.
Once the uv index is shown,it will be highlighted with low(lightyellow), moderate(yellow), high(orange), very high(red) and extreme(dark red).
I also linked jQuery, AJAX and Boostrap to showcase what I have stated above.
